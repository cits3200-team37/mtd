# MTDSimTime

A time-based simulator used for evaluating Moving Target Defence (MTD) techniques.

## How to run (linux + mac)
1. `make setup-mac`
2. for now, in two seperate terminal commands run
   - `make run`
   - `make docs`

## How to run (windows)
coming...

## Viewing Documentation

1. Install [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/)
   - `pip3 install mkdocs mkdocs-material`
2. Navigate to Documentation folder
   - `cd Documentation`
3. Run mkdocs
   - `mkdocs serve`
   - This will start a local server on port 8000
   - [page](http://localhost:8000/)

# Simulation

1. Create python virtual environment by running
   - `python3 -m venv venv`
2. Activate python virtual environment
   - This is different depending if you are on Mac or Windows
3. Install dependencies
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run `simulate.py`, this should create new directories where images from the simulation are stored

To run simulation in a jupyter notebook

1. Installing [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)
   - `conda env create -f simulation.environment.yml`
2. Activating the environment
   - `conda activate mtdsimtime`
3. Start Jupyter Notebook
   - `jupyter notebook`

## Getting Started (Old and only supported on Windows):

1. Installing [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)
2. Creating conda environment
   - `conda env create -f environment.yml`
   - `conda config --add channels conda-forge`
3. Activating the environment
   - `conda activate mtdsimtime`
4. Updating the environment
   - `conda env update --name mtdsimtime --file environment.yml --prune`

## Features

5. Evaluation based on MTTC

## System Architecture

The system uses the 3-layer HARM model to represent the network. This is a representation of the network, with the lowest levels on the bottom and the highest levels on the top:

| layer           | Description                                                                                                                             |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Network         | Made up of all the Hosts, connected in an Attack Graph, with exposed and un-exposed hosts that attackers will attempt to compromise     |
| Host            | Made up of several services (internal and external) in an Attack Graph. The host is compromised when an internal service is compromised |
| Services        | An attack tree of vulnerabilities. A service is compromised when the sum of the vulnerabilities exploited impact is above 7             |
| Vulnerabilities | Generated with a set Attack Complexity and Impact                                                                                       |

## Documents

see [docs](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime/blob/main/docs/) for all related documents.

## Setup the previous works only

switch to another branch (MTDSim / New-Attack-Method) or go directly to:

[MTDSim](https://github.com/Ccamm/MTDSim)

[MTDSimTze](https://github.com/tzewenlee99/MTDSimTze)

This was all run on Python 3.9.13 64 Bit. In the root directory in terminal, run the following commands in your virtual environment to setup the environment:

- Setup virtualenv
  - `python -m pip install virtualenv venv`
  - `python -m virtualenv venv`
- Activate environemnt
  - `source venv/bin/activate`
- Install dependencies
  - `python setup.py install`
  - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run an example: The following is only an example of how the function can be made, reference the run.py file or use the â€“help command to understand the parameters.
  - For New-Attack-Method:
    - `python batchrun.py`
  - For MTDSim:
    - `python -m mtdnetwork.run -m IPShuffle -n 50 -e 10 -s 5 -l 3 results.json`
