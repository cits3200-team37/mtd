1. set up new discrete event simulation structure:
    - get rid of the original `ActionManager` based structure
    - use [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to manage the time simulation, event processing, interaction (interruption)
    - use [time generator](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime/blob/main/mtdnetwork/component/time_generator.py) to generate exponential/normal/uniform/weibull/poisson variate

2. set up new mtd action flow in [mtd_operation](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime/blob/main/mtdnetwork/operation/mtd_operation.py):
    - introduce resource occupation mechanism:
        - MTD fetch resource when it executes, release resource when it completes
        - each resource has a `capacity` parameter (default=1) represents the number of available resource in the network.
        - two types of resource: network / application
            - network: [completetopologyshuffle](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime/blob/main/mtdnetwork/mtd/completetopologyshuffle.py), [hosttoplogyshuffle](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime/blob/main/mtdnetwork/mtd/hosttopologyshuffle.py), [ipshuffle](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime/blob/main/mtdnetwork/mtd/ipshuffle.py)
            - application: [osdiversity](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime/blob/main/mtdnetwork/mtd/osdiversity.py), [portshuffle](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime/blob/main/mtdnetwork/mtd/portshuffle.py), [servicediversity](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime/blob/main/mtdnetwork/mtd/servicediversity.py)
            - reserve: [usershuffle](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime/blob/main/mtdnetwork/mtd/usershuffle.py) (_todo_)
    - interrupt attack process:
        - network MTD operation: any attack action -> scan_host
        - application MTD operation: (scan_port, exploit_vuln, brute_force) -> scan_port
    -

3. Rework the attack profile to facilitate `SimPy` framework ([hacker](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime/blob/New-Attack-Method/mtdnetwork/hacker.py) -> [adversary](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime/blob/main/mtdnetwork/component/adversary.py))
    - scan_host: merged start network enum and set up host enum
    - enum_host: merged start host enum and process host enum
    - scan_port: merged port scan and check pass reuse
    - exploit_vuln: merged find and exploit vulns
    - brute_force: merged start and process brute force
    - scan_neighbor: merged start and set up new neighbors


4. Implement snapshot mechanism to save the state of the network object and the adversary object. Restrictions with generator object issues:
    - cannot save and maintain generator object generated by SimPy when saving
    - **solution**: [snapshot saving](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime/tree/main/mtdnetwork/snapshot) [operation](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime/tree/main/mtdnetwork/operation)
        - extract mtd_operation object from network object to handle state saving for network object
        - extract attack_operation object from adversary object to handle state saving for adversary object
        - introduce SnapshotCheckpoint to save and load files based on simulation time.

5. Refactor [data collection and analysis](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime/tree/main/mtdnetwork/statistic)

6. implement three [MTD Schemes](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime/tree/main/mtdnetwork/component/mtd_scheme): simultaneously, randomly, alternatively.

7. implement evaluation metrics: Mean Time to Compromise, Attack Success Rate, MTD Execute Frequency.
