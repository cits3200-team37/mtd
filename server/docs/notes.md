Graph Neural Network (GNN):
https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/comprehensive-introduction-graph-neural-networks-gnns-tutorial

Special types of neural networks capable of working with a graph data structure.

Typical tasks:
- graph classification: classify graphs into various categories
- **node classification**: use neighboring node labels to predict missing node labels in a graph
- edge prediction: predict edge between a pair of nodes with an incomplete adjacency matrix
- cluster detection: divide nodes into various clusters based on edge structure
- graph embedding: map graphs into vectors, preserving the relevant information on nodes, edges, structure
- graph generation: learns from sample graph distribution to generate a new but similar graph structure
