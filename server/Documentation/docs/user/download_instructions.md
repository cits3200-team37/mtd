# Download MTD Simulator Application

Currently we **have not** purchased the devlepment license for MacOS and Windows, so the application is not signed. You will need to bypass the security check to run the application. The steps on how to do so will be in the respective sections below.

The docs will update in due course when the license's is purchased.

**NOTE: it is currently recommended that MacOS users use the website version over the application.**
