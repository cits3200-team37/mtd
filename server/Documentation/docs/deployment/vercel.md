# Vercel

For this project we are currently deploying the front end framework to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Vercel is a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions.

The setup is very easy once you have an account setup. Simply click the add new button and link your Github account. Select the repository you want to deploy and Vercel will automatically detect the framework and build the site. You can then configure the deployment settings and deploy the site.
